This is a simple app developed using Android Studio and Kotlin. It contains two screens. A login screen and a product list screen. 
To run the app either connect an Android device via USB or download any Android emulator on Android Studio. Then click the run button. 
Once the app has opened, you will be brought to a login screen. Enter “admin” for the username and password to log in. The second screen contains a list of either food or equipment items.
